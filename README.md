# DexFuncGrasp
The official code of DexFuncGrasp, the code is ready to release once the paper accepted.

## Introduction

In this project, the grasp synthesis network is based on [KPConv](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv-PyTorch/blob/master/INSTALL.md), and we use [GraspIt!](http://graspit-simulator.github.io/build/html/installation_linux.html) to view the results. Please configure the development environment according to the instructions in links.

Installation process:
* Download this code and unzip it. Note: 'cpp_wrappers', etc. are from [KPConv].

* [KPConv](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv-PyTorch/blob/master/INSTALL.md): It is recommended to install the ubuntu version.

* [GraspIt!](http://graspit-simulator.github.io/build/html/installation_linux.html): It is recommended to install the ubuntu version.

* If your research continues to be based on the above two projects, please directly cite the original work.
